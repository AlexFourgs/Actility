This document can help you to understand how the application server works.
Which methods call which methods, what happen when the user click somewhere on the page /data...


1/ Application Server : Data collection

1.1) On ThingPark, we set the routing profile on this server "/".

1.2) When a data arrives, the method "listener()" is called.
      If it's a file xml the server uses the engine (method "save_data_file(file_xml)" & "general_engine(file_xml)").
        1.3) general_engine uses the method parse_xml(file_xml) for parse the file



     Else, it do nothing.
